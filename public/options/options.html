        Welcome to the GptGO Chrome Extension ("GptGO" or the "Extension"). This
        Extension utilizes the OpenAI Text-Davinci-003 API (the "API") to
        provide users with advanced text generation capabilities. By using
        GptGO, you agree to be bound by the following terms and conditions (the
        "Terms of Service" or "Agreement"). If you do not agree to these terms,
        do not use GptGO.
        <br />
        <br />
        API Usage and Cost Incurrence
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            GptGo utilizes OpenAI's Text-Davinci-003 API to provide its
            functionality. OpenAI grants all new users 3 months or $18 of free
            API usage. After this grant is over, users will need to upgrade to a
            "pay as you go" subscription in order to continue using GptGO. For
            users already paying for API usage, search requests from GptGO will
            incur costs to you. These costs will be incurred by you and are not
            included in the use of GptGO. You are solely responsible for any and
            all charges that may be incurred as a result of your use of the API
            through GptGO.
            <br />
            <br />
            You can always check your current usage at
