# GptGo

GptGo is a chrome extension that allows you to use ChatGPT directly from your browser. 

With GptGo, you can instantly interact with ChatGPT without ever leaving your tab. I built GptGo with React.js and it's been designed to be simple and intuitive to use. 

## Features

GptGO's flagship feature is Quick Search:
* Quick Search allows you to send/receive messages with ChatGPT without ever having to interact with a user interface
* Simply highlight a section of text, right click, and select the GptGO extension
* Within seconds, the response from ChatGPT will appear on your screen as a notification

GptGO also has a small popup window that allows you to type in your own prompt and read longer responses from ChatGPT.

## Installation

1. Visit the Chrome Web Store and search for GptGo.
2. Once you've found the GptGo extension, click "Add to Chrome".
3. Once the extension has installed, you'll be presented with a GptGo icon in the top-right corner of your browser.
4. Click the GptGo icon and you'll be taken to the GptGO setup page.
5. The setup takes less than 5 minutes, and you're ready to start using GptGo.
